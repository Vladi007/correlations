Hi everybody,

I am sure everyone has stumbled upon the word "Correlation" when doing Data Science.
As a beginner I started to explore it, but soon I realized that this topic is **HUGE**!!

I have finally competed my **Correlations starter pack** notebook which describes everything I learned about correlations. I really like to learn by experimenting, therefore I also included my experiments with different kinds of data.

I will be really greatful if you have any additional information regarding correlations that I missed.

Thank you!
